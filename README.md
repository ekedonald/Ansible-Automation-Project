## Ansible Client as a Jump Server (Bastion Host)
A [Jumo Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server) (sometimes also referred as [Bastion Host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host)) is an intermediary server through which access to internal network can be provided. If you think about the current architecture you are working on, ideally the Web Servers would be inside a secured network which cannot be reached directly from the Internet. That means, even DevOps engineers cannot `SSH` into the Web Servers directly and can only access it through a Jump Server - it provides better security and reduces [attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface)

In the diagram below, the Virtual Private Network (VPC) is divided into two subents (i.e. Public Subnet has Public IP Addresses and Private Subnet is only reachable by Private IP addresses).
